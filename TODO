The TODO list for the awesome bonsai server:

  - Prevent the use of .. in the URL for security.
  - List the files in a directory if the requested doesn't contain a index file. (like Apache)
  - Implement the Lua scripting for the config files (yes, all config files are going to be written in Lua).
  - Write the standards for the config files.
  - Implement the Virtual Host stuff in Lua.
  - Implement logging.

  x Improve the folder checking algorithm.
  x Colorize the console output.
